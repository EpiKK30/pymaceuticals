# Pymaceuticals, Inc. - Data Analysis Project

## Project Overview
As a senior data analyst at Pymaceuticals, Inc., the task was to analyze the data from the animal study and generate all the necessary tables and figures for the technical report of the clinical study. The project involved several tasks including data preparation, summary statistics generation, visualization creation, outlier detection, and correlation/regression analysis.

## Files
- Mouse Metadata: Contains information about the mice used in the study.
- Study Results: Contains the results of the animal study.

## Tasks
1. **Prepare the Data**: Merge the mouse metadata and study results into a single DataFrame. Check for duplicate data and clean the DataFrame.
2. **Generate Summary Statistics**: Calculate and present summary statistics such as mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume for each drug regimen.
3. **Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts**: Visualize the data using bar charts to show the total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen and pie charts to display the distribution of female versus male mice.
4. **Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot**: Calculate quartiles, identify outliers, and create a box plot to visualize the distribution of final tumor volumes for different treatment regimens.
5. **Create Line Plot and Scatter Plot**: Generate a line plot to visualize tumor volume versus time point for a single mouse treated with Capomulin and a scatter plot to show the relationship between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen.
6. **Calculate Correlation and Regression**: Calculate the correlation coefficient and perform linear regression analysis between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen.

## Project Completion
Once all tasks are completed, the final analysis, along with the code and visualizations, will be submitted for review.

## Dependencies
- Matplotlib
- Pandas
- Scipy

## Running the Code
- Ensure that all necessary dependencies are installed.
- Run the provided Python scripts in the order specified to perform the analysis.
